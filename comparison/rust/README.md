# Rust Implementation of the Ising Model Simulation

- Adjust run parameters (number of sweeps, lattice size, etc.) in the marked section in the
  beginning of src/main.rs.

- Compile and run:
```
cargo run [datadir]
```
where `datadir` is an optional argument to specify a directory to write the output files to.
It defaults to `data`.
Note that the directory and all files inside it get deleted if it already exists!
